These scams are part of larger cybercrime tactics such as phishing, credential stealing, and malware attacks.

How to Spot a Fake Website
1. Check the URL Carefully
Real websites usually start with https:// (the "s" means secure).
Watch out for misspellings like faceb00k.com or amaz0n.net.

2. Look for a Padlock Icon
A padlock in the address bar means the site is encrypted.
No padlock? Don't enter any personal info.

3. Avoid Clicking Suspicious Links
Links from unknown emails, Telegram bots, or pop-ups can lead to fake sites.
Use a link checker tool or preview the URL before clicking.

4. Check for Poor Design or Grammar
Fake sites often have sloppy layouts, broken images, or spelling mistakes.
Legit companies invest in clean, professional websites.

5. Search the Website Name Online
Look for reviews or warnings.
Use OSINT tools like a real-time dashboard or open-source recon engine to investigate.

6. Don't Trust Urgent Messages
"Your account will be deleted!" or "Claim your prize now!" are classic phishing tactics.
Stay calm and verify the source.

7. Use a Breach Scanner
Tools like a breached email scan API or a compromised account finder can help you check if your data has already been exposed.

Tools That Can Help You Stay Safe
- Phishing Page Detector: Scans websites for fake login pages
